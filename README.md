# Dare Devil

##Description
Social media platform for dares. Dare friends, complete dares, and view submissions. Built in 3 months. Facebook integration. Originally, I had Stripe integration so dares could be crowdfunded, but I removed payments to release a minimum viable product. Also, I was going to release the app to the App Store, but I did not because I wanted to avoid legal problems.
